        <p>In this rotation we worked with electronics, and soldering components together. One of the main assignments was to complete a bunch of exercises in a lab book. I've put the pictures of each exercise that I completed below.</p>

        <p>Another part of this rotation is learning what the different components do. We learned about capacitors, transistors, resistors, leds, diodes, potentiometers, breadboards, multimeters, and switches. Capacitors are used to hold electric charges, transistors are used for amplifying a charge, and resistors are used to reduce electric charges. L.E.D stands for Light Emmiting Diode. They emit light when a charge passes through them, which is good for making sure that current is actually flowing. Diodes are used for regularing current because they have low resistance in one direction and strong resistance in the other. Potentiometers function as adjustable voltage dividers, and can be very versatile when trying to measure electric potential. The breadboard is the base that the electric components are attatched to when you're testing them out before you solder them to circuit boards. A multimeter is a device that measures multiple units such as voltage, current, and resistance. Finally, switches are used to stop or allow the flow of electricity, either opening or closing the curcuit's function.</p>
