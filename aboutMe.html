<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Justin Scott and I'm taking a class on Digital Engineering. I took this course because I enjoy creative problem solving as well as creating. I'm excited to see what I can make in this class and what skills I learn that will help me to solve problems in the future.</p>
